NAME
	pushd - Saves the current working directory by pushing onto directory stack and then changes
    the new current working directory to DIR.
USAGE
	pushd 
DETAILS
	Saves the current working directory by pushing onto directory stack and then changes
    the new current working directory to DIR.
    The push is consistent to the LIFO behavior of a stack.
    The pushd command saves the old current working directory in directory stack so that
    it can be returned to at any time (via the popd command).
    The size of the directory stack is dynamic and dependent on the pushd and the popd commands.
