NAME
	popd - Remove the top entry from the directory stack, and cd into it.
USAGE
	popd
DETAILS
	Remove the top entry from the directory stack, and cd into it.
    The removal is consistent to the LIFO behavior of a stack.
    The popd command removes the top most directory from the directory stack and makes it the
    current working directory.
    If there is no directory onto the stack, then error message:
    "Error in popd: Directory stack is empty" is given
