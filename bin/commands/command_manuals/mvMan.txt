NAME
	mv -  Move item OLDPATH to NEWPATH. Both OLD-PATH and NEWPATH may be relative to the current 
	directory or may be full paths. If NEWPATH is a directory, move the item into the directory.
USAGE
	mv OLDPATH NEWPATH
NOTES (EXAMPLES)
	mv a b , where a and b are files, b will be overwritten with the contents of a. a will be
	removed.
	mv /a/b/c /a , where both paths are directories, directory c will be removed from /a/b
	and added to /a
	mv /a/b/c out , where /a/b/c is a directory and out is a file, this will throw an error because
	moving a directory to a file does not make any sense
