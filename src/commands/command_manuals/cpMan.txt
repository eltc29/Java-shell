NAME
	cp - recursively copy files and directories form oldpath to newpath
USAGE
	cd oldpath newpath
EXAMPLES
	Suppose you are currently in the root directory and there are 2 directories in the root
	called "dir1" and "dir3", and directory "dir2" and file "txt.txt" that is in "dir1" 
	
	cp dir1 dir3
	will result in the following filesystem (visualized in tree format)
	/
	  dir1
	  	dir2
	  	txt.txt
	  dir3
	  	dir2
	  	txt.txt
	  	
	note that cp file dir, and cp dir dir are defined like above,
	and that cp file file will overwrite target file with oldfile contents
	copying from directory into a file will give an error
