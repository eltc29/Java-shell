Download the repo to your computer. To run the program:
- Use your preferred IDE(for instance Eclipse) to create a project from the directory where you downloaded the files.
- Under 'src', run 'jShell.java' as java application.
- In the console, you'll see '#' which means that it is waiting for input from user. Just treat it like a Linux shell.
- List of simple commands: echo, cat, ls, cd, cp, mv, rmdir, rm, mkdir.
	- For e.g. try `echo 'helloworld' > a.txt` in the java console.
